# What is BarnameKon?
Barname Kon is telegram bot which create "Add to Calendar" link (Google Calendar) and file (.ics) for your event. It only accept Jalali date and Tehran time.


# How can I create my bot? 
I use [this](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-create-telegram-bot-in-python-cccc4babcc30) medium post and [official pyTelegramBOTAPI documents](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)


# How can I deploy my bot ?
I think fast,best and cheapest üòÅ way for deploy your Bot is heroku.
